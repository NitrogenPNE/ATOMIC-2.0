Version: 2.0.0
Author: Shawn Blackmore
License: ATOMIC-Limited-1.0

Overview
NIKI (Node Intelligence for Key Interactions) is a quantum-secure, AI-powered supernode for managing task scheduling, shard prediction, and tamper detection in the ATOMIC decentralized ecosystem. NIKI is designed for military-grade resilience, incorporating advanced encryption, NATO protocol compliance, and real-time failover mechanisms.

Key Features
1. Advanced Security
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): Ensures tamper-evident key exchange.
Lattice-Based Cryptography: Quantum-resistant algorithms (Kyber/Dilithium).
Hybrid Encryption: Combines RSA and AES-GCM for enhanced security.
TPM Integration: Hardware-based tamper detection and secure execution.
2. Military-Grade Protocol Compliance
NATO STANAG 4586 Support: Interoperable communication for secure message transport.
Zero-Trust Policy: Every transaction and interaction is validated.
3. AI-Driven Functionality
Shard Prediction Model: Optimizes data distribution across the network.
Tamper Detection Model: Detects anomalies in shard and task data.
Task Scheduler Model: Dynamically allocates resources for efficient task execution.
4. Resilience and Redundancy
Failover Systems: Real-time task replication and fallback mechanisms.
Load Balancing: Dynamic resource allocation for optimal performance.
Hardened Supernodes: Physically secure and fault-tolerant infrastructure.
5. Monitoring and Diagnostics
Real-Time Metrics: System health monitoring, including CPU load, QKD status, and latency.
Blockchain-Backed Logging: Immutable logs for configuration, tasks, and events.
Getting Started
1. Requirements
Node.js >= 16.0.0
NPM >= 8.0.0
Hardware:
TPM 2.0-compatible device or emulator (for tamper detection).
At least 8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and 200GB SSD.
2. Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/atomic-ltd/niki.git
cd niki
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Configuration
NIKI requires configuration files for operational settings:

Main Config File: config.json
json
Copy code
{
    "application": { "name": "NIKI", "version": "2.0.0", "role": "AI Supernode" },
    "security": { "encryption": { "type": "quantum-resistant" } },
    "node": { "id": "NIKI-001", "role": "AI Supernode" }
}
Encryption Keys: Stored under Config/encryptionKeys/
Run the key generator script:
bash
Copy code
npm run generate-keys
Scripts

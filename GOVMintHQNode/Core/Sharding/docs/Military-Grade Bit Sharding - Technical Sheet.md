ATOMIC Military-Grade Bit Sharding - Technical Sheet
1. Purpose
The Military-Grade Bit Sharding Module encrypts, shards, and distributes data into bit atoms optimized for HQNode, CorporateHQNode, and NationalDefenseHQNode networks. It leverages advanced encryption, blockchain logging, and AI-powered shard placement via NIKI for secure and efficient data handling.

2. Key Features
Data Encryption: Uses AES-256-GCM for secure encryption.
Bit Sharding: Breaks data into atomic bit units, integrating particle classification (proton, neutron, electron).
Blockchain Logging: Logs shard creation and frequencies to ATOMIC blockchain for traceability.
AI Optimization: NIKI prediction engine optimizes shard placement across nodes.
Military-Grade Security: Aligns with the stringent security requirements of National Defense HQNodes.

Encrypt Data
Inputs: Data to encrypt, corporateId.
Process:
Encrypts data using AES-256-GCM with a node-specific encryption key and a random IV.
Output: Encrypted data, IV, and authentication tag.
Shard Data into Bits
Inputs: Encrypted data, nodeType, corporateId.
Process:
Converts encrypted data into a binary buffer.
Breaks buffer into bit atoms and assigns particle classifications.
Logs shard frequencies and IV/authTag metadata to the ledger.
Output: Sharded bit atoms and optimal nodes for placement.
Log Shard Frequencies
Inputs: Shard address, bit atoms, IV, authTag.
Process:
Logs shard frequency data for protons, neutrons, and electrons into node-specific ledgers.
Ensures metadata is securely stored and auditable.

Optimize Placement with NIKI
Inputs: Node address, bit atoms.
Process:
Predicts optimal node distribution for shards using the NIKI AI engine.
Output: Optimized shard placement strategy.

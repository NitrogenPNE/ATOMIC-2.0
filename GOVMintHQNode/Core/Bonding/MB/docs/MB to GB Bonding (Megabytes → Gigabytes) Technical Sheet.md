ATOMIC MB to GB Bonding (Megabytes â†’ Gigabytes) Technical Sheet
1. Purpose of MB to GB Bonding
The MB to GB Bonding module consolidates MB (Megabyte) atoms into GB (Gigabyte) atoms within the ATOMIC blockchain system. This process enhances data efficiency, maintains rigorous data integrity, and validates bonding operations using blockchain contracts.

2. Overview of MB to GB Bonding
The MB to GB Bonding process:

Aggregates 1024 MB atoms to form a single GB atom.
Ensures compliance with bonding rules via smart contracts.
Records bonded GB atoms in the blockchain for audit and tamper-proofing.
Synchronizes ledger data between MB and GB levels for consistency.

4. MB to GB Bonding Workflow
4.1 Aggregation
Input:

Proton, Electron, and Neutron MB atoms from user-specific ledgers.
Each ledger stores atoms with metadata (frequency, timestamp).
Process:

Load 1024 MB atoms from each type using loadJson().
Validate the sufficiency of atoms using validateBonding().
Aggregate atoms and calculate their overall frequency using calculateGroupFrequency().
Output:

A single GB atom containing metadata and aggregated data from the MB atoms.
4.2 Validation
Input:

Groups of 1024 MB atoms (Proton, Electron, Neutron).
Process:

Validate the groups using the validateBonding() smart contract.
Ensure the atoms meet bonding criteria (e.g., quantity, frequency).
Output:

A valid set of atoms ready for bonding.
4.3 Ledger Management
Input:

A bonded GB atom.
Process:

Save the bonded GB atom to the GB ledger using saveJson().
Update the MB ledger to reflect consumed atoms.
Output:

Updated MB and GB ledgers with bonding records.
4.4 Blockchain Integration
Input:

The bonded GB atom.
Process:

Log the bonding event in the blockchain using logBondEvent().
Output:

A tamper-proof blockchain record of the GB bonding operation.
5. Security and Fault Tolerance

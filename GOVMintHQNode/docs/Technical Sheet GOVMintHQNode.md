Strengths in Security
1. Quantum-Resistant Cryptography
Description: The system uses lattice-based cryptography and SHA-3 for hashing and digital signatures, protecting against attacks from quantum computers.
Impact: This ensures that even if quantum computing becomes viable, the cryptographic backbone of the minting process will remain secure.
2. Federated Governance
Description: Governance decisions, such as minting and shard allocations, require quorum-based voting (67% approval) validated by multi-signature protocols.
Impact: No single entity can unilaterally issue or manipulate cryptocurrency, reducing risks of corruption or unauthorized operations.
3. Proof-of-Access Validation
Description: Every minting operation is tied to a validated token that requires both cryptographic integrity and operational compliance.
Impact: Ensures only authorized nodes can mint or validate transactions, preventing impersonation or rogue node operations.
4. Centralized Key Management
Description: Keys used for signing transactions and validating operations are securely stored, rotated, and logged via a dedicated Key Management System (KMS).
Impact: Mitigates risks of key compromise, which could otherwise lead to unauthorized minting.
5. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts
Description: Continuous monitoring of resource usage, shard throughput, and transaction latency ensures anomalies are detected and addressed promptly.
Impact: Prevents attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) by maintaining operational stability and availability.
6. Immutable Logging
Description: All decisions, transactions, and operational events are logged in the blockchain ledger and a Central Logging Node.
Impact: Provides a tamper-proof audit trail, ensuring accountability and simplifying forensic investigations.
7. Decentralized Architecture
Description: Distributed nodes and shard-based blockchain reduce single points of failure.
Impact: Increases system resilience against targeted attacks on any individual node.
8. Token-Based Minting
Description: Minting is tied to issued tokens, which are validated against a ledger and Proof-of-Access criteria.
Impact: Prevents unauthorized minting by ensuring all operations are tied to verifiable, pre-issued tokens.
Potential Weaknesses
1. Dependency on Node Security
Risk: Each HQNode must independently implement security measures (e.g., monitoring, key management, logging).
Mitigation: Uniform security policies and automated deployment scripts ensure nodes comply with the required standards.
2. Centralized Logging Node
Risk: If the Central Logging Node is compromised, logs could be tampered with or stolen.
Mitigation: Strong encryption, secure transmission protocols, and limited network access protect logging integrity.
3. External Dependencies
Risk: Reliance on external APIs (e.g., exchange rates) introduces a dependency that could be exploited if API responses are compromised.
Mitigation: Fallback mechanisms, rate-limiting, and strict validation of API responses ensure resilience.
4. Human Error
Risk: Misconfigurations or operational errors could weaken the overall system.
Mitigation: Automated setup and configuration validation reduce risks of human error during deployment and operation.

ATOMIC Data Classification Technical Sheet
1. Purpose
The Data Classification Logic module is a foundational component of the ATOMIC blockchain designed to classify input data into actionable atomic structures. It supports a wide array of classifications, including military-specific data types, ensuring efficient data processing and shard assignment.

2. Key Features
Data Classification: Identifies and categorizes data based on type, size, and military significance.
Contract Integration: Utilizes blockchain-based classification contracts for secure and traceable operations.
Real-Time Processing: Supports immediate tagging of critical military-specific data.
Scalability: Handles both in-memory and file-based data sources.
Customizable Thresholds: Configurable size limits for large data classification.
3. Module Breakdown
Location:

3.1 Core Functions
classifierLogicWithContract(data, filePath, userId)

Purpose: Performs classification with integration into the ClassifierLogicContract.
Workflow:
Detects the type of the input data.
Creates a classification proposal using the blockchain contract.
Executes the classification process and logs results.
Output: Classification results, including data type, size, and whether it's military-specific.
performClassification(data, filePath, detectedType)

Purpose: Processes data to generate detailed classification metadata.
Workflow:
Calculates data size in KB.
Flags data as large if it exceeds the defined threshold.
Identifies whether the data type is military-specific.
Output: Object containing type, size, large file flag, and military-specific flag.
detectType(data, filePath)

Purpose: Identifies the type of data based on its content or file extension.
Workflow:
Matches file extensions to known types, with priority for military-specific classifications.
Defaults to "unknown" for unsupported formats.
Output: Data type (e.g., satellite image, structured, text).
calculateSizeInKB(data, filePath)

Purpose: Computes the size of the input data in KB.
Workflow:
Uses filesystem statistics for file-based data.
Serializes in-memory data for size calculation.
Output: Data size in KB.

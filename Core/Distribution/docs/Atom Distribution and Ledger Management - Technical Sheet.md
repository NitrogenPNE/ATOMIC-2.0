ATOMIC Atom Distribution and Ledger Management - Technical Sheet
1. Purpose
The Atom Distribution and Ledger Management Module is responsible for the secure and efficient distribution of atomic units (BITS, BYTES, KB, MB, GB, TB) across HQNode, CorporateHQNode, and NationalDefenseHQNode ledgers. It ensures traceability, integrity, and compliance by logging all metadata on the blockchain and uses AI-powered optimization for placement.

2. Key Features
Multi-Layer Distribution: Handles atomic data distribution across node types.
Traceability: Logs all operations and metadata on the blockchain.
AI Optimization: Utilizes predictive engines for distribution strategies.
Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and validation of all operations.
Multi-Particle Support: Manages protons, neutrons, and electrons individually.

distributeAtomsByType(type, userAddress, duration, proposalId)
Purpose: Handles the distribution of atoms of a specific type (e.g., BITS, KB).
Workflow:
Iterates through all addresses associated with the atom type.
Distributes particles (proton, neutron, electron) individually.
Output: Distribution log and updated ledger for the specific type.
distributeBasedOnNode(userAddress, duration, proposalId, type, address, bounceRates)
Purpose: Manages the distribution of atoms for a specific node.
Workflow:
Ensures directory structure for the address.
Merges bounce rate data with existing entries.
Logs updated distribution metadata for each particle type.
Output: Updated ledger entries for the node.
loadBounceRates(typePath, address)
Purpose: Loads bounce rate data for specific particles (proton, neutron, electron).
Output: Array of bounce rates.
mergeUniqueData(existingData, newRates, metaData)
Purpose: Ensures unique merging of new bounce rate data with existing ledger entries.
Workflow:
Uses unique keys (bitIndex and particle) to identify duplicates.
Appends new rates where applicable.
Output: Deduplicated ledger data.
4. Distribution Workflow
4.1 Initialization
Input: None.

ATOMIC Core Technical Sheet
1. Purpose
The ATOMIC Core is the foundation of the Advanced Technologies Optimizing Integrated Chains (ATOMIC) ecosystem. It handles data classification, encryption, sharding, bonding, distribution, fusion, and blockchain integration. The core is designed for military-grade security, scalability, and AI-powered optimization, making it ideal for critical infrastructures like HQNode, CorporateHQNode, and NationalDefenseHQNode networks.

2. Key Features
Data Classification:

Identifies and tags data based on type, size, and classification policies.
Supports military-specific types like signals intelligence, geospatial data, and imagery intelligence.
Ensures that unclassified or malformed data is rejected.
Sharding and Bonding:

Breaks data into atomic units (bit, byte, KB, MB, GB, TB) using secure AES-256-GCM encryption.
Bonds smaller atomic units into larger units, ensuring data integrity and traceability.
Logs bonding events to the blockchain.
Data Distribution:

Distributes shards across nodes using AI-driven prediction (NIKI) for optimal placement.
Ensures redundancy and traceability through ledger management and blockchain logging.
Data Reconstruction (Fusion):

Reconstructs data from distributed shards with multi-node redundancy.
Validates the integrity of fused data using blockchain-backed contracts.
Blockchain Integration:

Logs shard creation, bonding, classification, and fusion events.
Provides immutable audit trails for all core operations.

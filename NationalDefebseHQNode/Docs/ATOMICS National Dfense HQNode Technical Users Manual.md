4. User Roles and Permissions
This section outlines the user roles and access control mechanisms implemented in the National Defense HQ Node. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and tiered clearance levels ensure secure and controlled access to the system's resources.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC defines distinct roles with specific responsibilities and access privileges. These roles are configured in the system to align with operational requirements.

Roles and Responsibilities
Role	Description	Key Permissions
Administrator	Has full control over the system. Manages configurations, user access, and operational settings.	- Access all modules
- Manage configurations
- Execute incident response playbooks
Operator	Manages day-to-day operations, including shard distribution and monitoring.	- View and manage system metrics
- Trigger playbooks
- Manage shard allocation
Analyst	Focuses on system analysis, monitoring threats, and generating reports.	- Access logs
- Perform system health checks
- Run validation and compliance tests
Developer	Develops and integrates new features, and fixes issues.	- Access development logs
- Test modules
- Execute CI/CD pipelines
Clearance Levels
The system integrates clearance levels (Tier 1 to Tier 5) to provide additional granularity for access control. These tiers are enforced through the personnelClearanceManager.js.

Clearance Tier Mapping
Tier	Access Level
Tier 1	Basic access to logs and system health data. Limited to read-only operations.
Tier 2	Access to operational modules such as shard distribution and monitoring dashboards.
Tier 3	Elevated access to security modules, including compliance checks and incident response simulations.
Tier 4	Advanced access to orchestration and validation layers. Includes permissions to trigger system-wide updates.
Tier 5	Full system control, including configuration management and playbook execution.
Integration with personnelClearanceManager.js
Validation Logic: The clearance level is dynamically checked using the validateAccess function in personnelClearanceManager.js. If a user attempts to access a restricted module, their clearance level is verified against the required tier.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
const { validateAccess } = require("./Personnel/personnelClearanceManager");

// Validate user access
const hasAccess = await validateAccess("userId-001", "Tier 4");
if (!hasAccess) {
  console.error("Access denied: Insufficient clearance level.");
}
Role Synchronization: Each role is linked with a default clearance tier:

Administrator: Tier 5
Operator: Tier 4
Analyst: Tier 3
Developer: Tier 2
These mappings can be overridden using custom configurations in clearanceRecords.json.

Access Logging
Every access attempt, whether successful or denied, is logged in accessLogs.json. This log provides a detailed trail of user activity, supporting audits and forensic investigations.

Access Log Format
json
Copy code
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-11-27T10:00:00Z",
      "username": "operator123",
      "action": "Access Shard Validator",
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Access granted for Tier 4 clearance."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-11-27T10:15:00Z",
      "username": "analyst456",
      "action": "Access Compliance Manager",
      "status": "failure",
      "message": "Access denied: Insufficient clearance level."
    }
  ]
}
Access Logging Workflow
Initiate Access: A user attempts to access a module or perform an action.
Validate Access: The system checks the user's clearance tier and role permissions.
Log Result: The access result (success or failure) is logged in accessLogs.json.
Log Maintenance:
Logs are rotated daily to maintain performance.
Older logs are archived to a secure directory for long-term storage.
With these mechanisms, the National Defense HQ Node ensures that only authorized users can access critical operations, adhering to Zero Trust principles and providing robust auditing capabilities.

Technical Sheet: C:\ATOMIC 2.0\API
Overview
The C:\ATOMIC 2.0\API folder implements a RESTful API for the ATOMIC system, designed to interact with and manage its decentralized, quantum-inspired blockchain infrastructure. It provides endpoints for:

Managing nodes and supernodes.
Performing analytics and generating reports.
Conducting health checks for system reliability.
Synchronizing nodes and supernodes.
This folder is built to integrate seamlessly into ATOMIC's decentralized architecture while ensuring security, scalability, and extensibility.

Purpose
Primary Goals
Node Management:

Monitor and manage ATOMIC nodes and supernodes through RESTful endpoints.
Synchronize nodes to maintain consistency across the decentralized network.
Analytics:

Collect, process, and generate insights about the network, nodes, and performance.
Enable natural language query processing for reports.
Health Monitoring:

Conduct system-wide health checks for nodes, supernodes, and the API itself.
Security:

Authenticate requests using API tokens.
Rate-limit requests to prevent abuse.
Scalability:

Designed for modularity, allowing additional controllers, routes, and features to be added effortlessly.
Features
Core Functionalities
Node Operations:

Retrieve the status of specific nodes or supernodes.
Restart nodes or supernodes.
Synchronize all nodes and supernodes.
Analytics:

Retrieve network-wide metrics and node performance data.
Generate analytics reports (e.g., system health, node performance, network summary).
Process natural language queries for insights.
Health Checks:

Verify the API's health with a lightweight /health endpoint.
Diagnose issues in nodes and supernodes through comprehensive diagnostics.
Security
API Token Authentication:

Verifies incoming requests using Bearer tokens.
Tokens are managed via environment variables for security.
Rate Limiting:

Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per IP address within a given timeframe.
CORS Configuration:

Restricts access to the API from unauthorized origins.
Modularity
Controller-Based Design:

Business logic is abstracted into dedicated controllers for analytics, nodes, and health checks.
Middleware:

Handles security, request metadata, and validation.
Validators:

Ensures all inputs conform to expected formats, improving reliability and security.
Key Components
1. server.js
Purpose:

Initializes and runs the Express.js server.
Configures middleware, loads routes, and starts listening on the configured port.
Features:

Centralized configuration using dotenv.
Supports both direct execution and programmatic initialization (via startServer).
2. routes.js
Purpose:

Defines and groups all API routes by functionality.
Features:

Node Management:
Endpoints for managing and monitoring nodes (/nodes) and supernodes (/supernodes).
Analytics:
Endpoints for querying metrics and generating reports (/analytics).
Health Checks:
Health check endpoints (/health).
Synchronization:
Unified endpoint for node and supernode synchronization.
3. middleware.js
Purpose:

Provides reusable middleware for security, logging, and metadata management.
Key Middleware:

Helmet: Adds HTTP security headers.
CORS: Manages cross-origin requests.
Rate Limiting: Prevents API abuse.
Quantum Metadata: Adds unique request IDs and timestamps for debugging.
Authentication: Verifies API tokens.
4. utils.js
Purpose:

Encapsulates helper functions for reusability.
Key Functions:

generateQuantumId: Creates unique identifiers for debugging.
verifyToken: Validates API tokens.
createResponse: Standardizes API responses.
hashData: Provides SHA-256 hashing.
5. validators.js
Purpose:

Ensures inputs conform to expected formats.
Key Validations:

Validates nodeId and supernodeId formats.
Validates analytics query strings and report types.
Handles validation errors gracefully.
6. controllers/
a. nodeController.js
Manages and monitors nodes and supernodes.
Provides endpoints for:
Retrieving node and supernode statuses.
Restarting nodes and supernodes.
Synchronizing the network.
b. analyticsController.js
Handles analytics operations.
Provides endpoints for:
Collecting network-wide metrics.
Generating analytics reports.
Processing natural language queries.
c. healthController.js
Performs system health diagnostics.
Provides endpoints for:
API health checks.
Node and supernode diagnostics.
7. docs/openapi.yaml
Purpose:

Defines the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for the API.
Features:

Documents all API endpoints, parameters, and responses.
Provides interactive documentation through Swagger UI.
8. config/default.json
Purpose:
Stores configuration settings like the API port and token.
9. package.json
Purpose:

Manages dependencies, scripts, and metadata for the API.
Scripts:

start: Runs the server in production mode.
dev: Starts the server with nodemon for hot-reloading.
lint: Runs ESLint to check for code issues.
test: Runs tests using Jest.

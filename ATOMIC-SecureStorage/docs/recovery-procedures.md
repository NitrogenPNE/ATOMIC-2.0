# ATOMIC Recovery Procedures

## Overview

This guide outlines the recovery procedures for the ATOMIC system, including steps for restoring critical data, regenerating encryption keys, and reinitializing nodes in case of failure. The recovery process ensures the system can be restored to full functionality while maintaining data integrity and security.

---

## Key Recovery Components

1. **Backup Files**:
   - Securely stored system backups, including shard metadata, ledger data, and encryption keys.

2. **Recovery Scripts**:
   - Scripts for validating and restoring backups:
     - `validate-backup.js`
     - `restore-system.js`
     - `recovery-init.js`

3. **Recovery Tools**:
   - Built-in utilities for reinitializing nodes, reconstructing the ledger, and restoring shards.

4. **Master Key Recovery**:
   - A dedicated process for recovering or restoring the Master Key.

## 1. Backup Validation

Before initiating recovery, validate the integrity of backup files to ensure they are complete and uncorrupted.

### Steps:
1. Run the Backup Validator:
   ```bash
   node recovery-scripts/validate-backup.js --backupPath recovery/system-backup.zip
If validation fails:
Verify the backup file checksum using:
bash
Copy code
sha256sum recovery/system-backup.zip
Compare the output to the checksum stored in system-backup.zip.sig.
2. Restoring the System
Restoring from a Valid Backup
Execute the recovery script:

bash
Copy code
node recovery-scripts/restore-system.js
Monitor the restoration process:

Logs are generated in the recovery log directory:
bash
Copy code
recovery/recovery-logs/recovery-<timestamp>.log
Validate the restoration:

Confirm nodes are active:
bash
Copy code
node monitor-nodes.js --status
Verify ledger integrity:
bash
Copy code
node ledger-validator.js
3. Restoring Encryption Keys
Using Backup Keys
Locate the encrypted backup keys:

bash
Copy code
recovery/recovery-keys.json
Run the key restoration script:

bash
Copy code
node recovery-scripts/recovery-init.js --restore-keys
Confirm restored keys are loaded:

bash
Copy code
node key-manager.js --verify
4. Reconstructing the Blockchain Ledger
If the blockchain ledger is corrupted or incomplete, reconstruct it from the latest valid snapshot.

Steps:
Start the Ledger Reconstruction Tool:

bash
Copy code
node ledger-reconstruction.js
Provide the location of the backup snapshot:

bash
Copy code
backups/ledger-snapshot-<date>.zip
Verify the reconstructed ledger:

bash
Copy code
node ledger-validator.js
5. Reinitializing Nodes
If nodes fail to restart after a system restoration, follow these steps:

Clear corrupted data:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf WorkerNode/data/*
Reinitialize the Worker Node:

bash
Copy code
node worker-node.js --initialize
For Supernodes:

Clear ledger inconsistencies:
bash
Copy code
rm -rf Supernodes/ledger/*
Reinitialize the Supernode:
bash
Copy code
node supernode.js --initialize
6. Recovery for Specific Failures
Shard Corruption
Identify corrupted shards:

bash
Copy code
node shard-manager.js --check-integrity
Reconstruct corrupted shards:

bash
Copy code
node shard-reconstruction.js --shardId <shard_id>
Verify shard integrity:

bash
Copy code
node shard-manager.js --verify
Troubleshooting Recovery Issues
Backup Validation Fails
Verify that the backup file matches the checksum stored in the .sig file.
Use a clean backup if available.
Decryption Errors
Ensure the correct encryption key is loaded:
bash
Copy code
node key-manager.js --load
Node Fails to Start
Check the recovery logs for error details.
Reinitialize the affected node and verify its configuration.
Best Practices for Recovery
Regular Backups:

Automate backups to ensure the availability of the latest data.
Use the Backup Scheduler:
bash
Copy code
node backup-scheduler.js
Validate Backups Periodically:

Schedule validation checks using:
bash
Copy code
node validate-backup.js --cron
Secure Key Backups:

Always encrypt backup keys and store them securely.
Monitor Recovery Logs:

Continuously monitor recovery logs to identify and resolve issues early.

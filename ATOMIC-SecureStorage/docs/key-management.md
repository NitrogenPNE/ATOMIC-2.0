node validate-backup.js
Restore the system:

bash
Copy code
node restore-system.js
Troubleshooting
Node Issues
If a node fails to start, verify the config.json file.
Check network connectivity:
bash
Copy code
ping <node-ip>
Shard Distribution Problems
Restart the Shard Manager:
bash
Copy code
node shard-manager.js --restart
Transaction Errors
Verify transaction hashes:
bash
Copy code
node validate-transactions.js
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: How do I add a new node to the system?
A: Configure the new node in node-config.json and start it using the appropriate node script.
Q: What happens if the Master Key is lost?
A: Use the recovery tools and restore keys from the encrypted backup.

# ATOMIC Key Management Guide

## Overview

Effective key management is critical to the security and functionality of the ATOMIC system. This document outlines how to securely generate, store, rotate, and recover encryption keys in ATOMIC. These keys are used for securing data shards, transactions, and system communication.

---

## Key Types in ATOMIC

1. **Master Key**:
   - Used to derive all other encryption keys.
   - Only accessible to Supernodes.

2. **Shard Keys**:
   - Unique encryption keys for individual data shards.
   - Generated by the Shard Manager.

3. **Transaction Signing Keys**:
   - RSA key pairs used to digitally sign transactions for integrity and authenticity.

4. **Backup Keys**:
   - Encrypt backups of critical files, such as `keys.json` and shard metadata.

---

## Key Storage Locations

1. **Primary Key Store**:
   - Encryption keys are securely stored in:
     ```
     encryption-keys/keys.json
     ```

2. **Backup Key Store**:
   - A secure, encrypted backup is stored in:
     ```
     recovery/recovery-keys.json
     ```

3. **Temporary Keys**:
   - Short-lived keys for ephemeral operations, such as session encryption, are stored in memory and not written to disk.

---

## Key Generation

### Master Key

1. Generate a new Master Key:
   ```bash
   node key-manager.js --generate-master
Confirm the key was successfully stored in keys.json:
json
Copy code
{
    "masterKey": "base64-encoded-master-key",
    "createdAt": "2023-11-28T12:00:00.000Z"
}
Shard Keys
Shard Keys are automatically generated by the Shard Manager. You can view or regenerate keys using:

bash
Copy code
node shard-manager.js --generate-keys
Transaction Signing Keys
Generate an RSA key pair for signing:

bash
Copy code
node key-manager.js --generate-rsa
The keys will be stored as:

Public Key: signatures/public-key.pem
Private Key: signatures/private-key.pem
Key Rotation
Regular key rotation minimizes the risk of compromise. ATOMIC supports automated and manual key rotation.

Automated Rotation
Configure rotation settings in key-rotation-config.json:

json
Copy code
{
    "rotationFrequency": "90d",
    "keyTypes": ["master", "shard", "transaction"]
}
Start the Key Rotation Service:

bash
Copy code
node key-manager.js --start-rotation
Manual Rotation
Rotate keys manually using:

bash
Copy code
node key-manager.js --rotate --keyType master
Confirm the new keys in keys.json:

json
Copy code
{
    "masterKey": "new-base64-encoded-master-key",
    "previousKeys": ["old-base64-encoded-key"],
    "rotatedAt": "2023-11-28T15:30:00.000Z"
}
Key Recovery
Backup Restoration
Locate the backup keys:

bash
Copy code
recovery/recovery-keys.json
Restore keys using the Recovery Tool:

bash
Copy code
node recovery-init.js --restore-keys
Confirm the restored keys:

bash
Copy code
node key-manager.js --verify
Master Key Recovery
Ensure the encrypted backup is available in recovery/recovery-keys.json.
Run the recovery script:
bash
Copy code
node recovery-init.js --master-key
Security Best Practices
Access Control:

Restrict access to keys.json and recovery-keys.json to authorized Supernodes.
Secure Key Backups:

Always encrypt backups and store them in secure locations.
Audit Logs:

Monitor key usage and rotation logs to detect unauthorized access.
Regular Rotation:

Rotate keys every 90 days to reduce exposure.
Use Hardware Security Modules (HSM):

Where possible, store master keys in an HSM for additional protection.
Troubleshooting Key Issues
Key File Missing
Restore from the backup key store:
bash
Copy code
node recovery-init.js --restore-keys
Decryption Failures
Ensure the correct key is being used and confirm the integrity of the encrypted file.
Key Rotation Errors
Check the key-rotation-config.json file for misconfiguration.
Verify logs for errors using:
bash
Copy code
node key-manager.js --log
